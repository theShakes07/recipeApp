# recipeApp
Recipe app with repository (Java, Spring, Gradle, MySQL, Thymeleaf, CSS). You can register your profile, then (after the login, authenticated with JWT token) you can add new recipes to database. Can modify your profile informations (password, email address) and your own recipes. You can add recipes to your favourites (of course remove it) and you can delete your own recipe from database and this remove recipe from every user favourite list. You can search by name, and have a simple function (if you don't want to think about what you want to cook), which returns a random recipe. Every function has a validation from backend side. The API has a simple UI, which is made with Thymeleaf and CSS (with some bootstrap).
